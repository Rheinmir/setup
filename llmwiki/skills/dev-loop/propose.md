description: Plan a feature before coding — draft in wiki/sources/draft/, stop for approval
---

# Skill: propose

## Purpose
Plan feature/change before writing code. Surfaces impact on existing functionality, gets alignment before implementation.

## When to use
- New feature, endpoint, component, or behaviour requested
- Change touches shared/core code
- Scope unclear or multi-interpretable

## Steps
1. Restate request in one sentence to confirm understanding.
2. List every existing file, function, or module affected or must change.
3. List every existing feature or behaviour that could break as side effect.
4. Propose minimal implementation plan as numbered steps.
5. State what success looks like (verifiable criteria).
6. Create draft file at `llmwiki/wiki/sources/draft/DDMMYY-feature-name-module.md` (e.g. `260425-new-approval-button-fe.md`) containing proposal output from steps 1–5. Add row to `llmwiki/wiki/index.md` and append to `llmwiki/wiki/log.md`.
7. STOP. No code. Wait for user to approve or redirect.

## Rules
- Never begin implementation during this skill.
- If impact list empty, state explicitly "No existing code affected."
- If multiple approaches exist, present with tradeoffs — do not pick silently.
