"""bnal_config — shared BNAL adapter loader. ONE place replacing the load_config() that was
copy-pasted into ~17 features. Each feature: cfg = bnal_config.load(root, "<name>", FALLBACK).

Reads harness/<name>.config.yaml, overlays non-None keys onto a deep copy of the fallback dict.
Fail-open: missing file / no PyYAML / parse error → fallback. The adapter boundary is unchanged —
the config FILE is still the one quarantine per feature; only this loader is shared."""
